The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which on Wednesday managed to create a dent in the Communist Party of India’s (Marxist) stronghold in Siliguri got a shot in the arms as  Shankar Ghosh the rebel 

leader formally joined the saffron party. 

Ghosh who joined the party on Friday in presence of Kailash Vijaybarghya the party's West Bengal in charge and Raju Bista the Darjeeling MP is likely to become the saffron party’s candidate for the April 17 assembly election from Siliguri. 

Siliguri in Darjeeling district is known as one of the few strongholds of the CPI (M) in West Bengal where the party had won the 2015 Siliguri Municipal Corporation (SMC), Siliguri Mahakuma Parishad elections and 2016 assembly election.

BJP sources said, “Ghosh has been given assurance to contest as the BJP candidate from Siliguri.”

  Though Ghosh did not name anyone, he said, “In Siliguri, only one man’s decision is final.”  

Ghosh was indirectly referring to veteran CPI (M) leader Asok Bhattacharya the sitting Siliguri MLA who is again contesting on the CPI (M)’s ticket.

Bhattacharya was the four-time minister before the Left Front lost the assembly election in 2011 at the hands of the Trinamool Congress.

  Bhattacharya was the party’s candidate in 2011 election also, but lost. In 2016, he won. After 2015 SMC election, he became the mayor of Siliguri and is still the chairman of board of administrators in the SMC.

Addressing a press conference on Wednesday evening, Ghosh an assistant professor said “There was no room for differences of opinion in the party.”

Bhattacharya could not be contacted.

   Ghosh according to sources would be the BJP’s candidate from Siliguri.

The TMC is also divided here after it announced the name of Om Prakash Mishra as its Siliguri candidate. Nantu Paul a senior TMC leader has already announced that he will contest against Mishra, who Paul thinks is an outsider.
